# Sparamix.SQualCheck v0.1.1:  A Simple S-Parameter Quality Checker

A simple utility tool for evaluating S-parameter (Touchstone) file quality based on IEEE 370 standard. SQualCheck provides both GUI and CLI interfaces to assess passivity, reciprocity, and causality metrics in frequency and time domains.

Based on IEEE 370 code, re-implemented in Python using AI coders.

**This code and repo is intended to be a learning experience. The results are correlated to the original code. Use discretion and caution when using. **

  - Clipboard support for Excel/PowerPoint integration

### 📊 Quality Metrics - Initial (Frequency Domain) - good for quick check

| Level | Symbol | Passivity (PQMi) | Reciprocity (RQMi)  | Causality (CQMi) | Description |
|-------|--------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| 🟢 Good | ✓ | (99.9, 100] | (99.9, 100]  | (80, 100] | Excellent quality, suitable for critical applications |
| 🔵 Acceptable | ○ | (99, 99.9] | (99, 99.9] | (50, 80] | OK quality, may not be suitable for sensitive applications like de-embedding |
| 🟡 Inconclusive | △ | (80, 99] | (80, 99] | (20, 50] | Marginal quality, unlikely to be reliable |
| 🔴 POOR | ✗ | [0, 80] | [0, 80] | [0, 20] | Poor quality, do not use! Re-measurement (+ VNA recalibration) recommended |

### 📊 Quality Metrics - Application-based (Time Domain) - rigorously computed

| Level | Symbol | Passivity (PQMa) | Reciprocity (RQMa)  | Causality (CQMa) | Description |
|-------|--------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| 🟢 Good | ✓ | [0 mV, 5 mV) | [0 mV, 5 mV) | [0 mV, 5 mV) | Excellent quality, suitable for critical applications |
| 🔵 Acceptable | ○ | [5 mV, 10 mV) | [5 mV, 10 mV) | [5 mV, 10 mV) | OK quality, may not be suitable for sensitive applications like de-embedding |
| 🟡 Inconclusive | △ | [10 mV, 15 mV) | [10 mV, 15 mV) | [10 mV, 15 mV) | Marginal quality, unlikely to be reliable |
| 🔴 POOR | ✗ | [15 mV, +∞) | [15 mV, +∞) | [15 mV, +∞) | Poor quality, do not use! Re-measurement (+ VNA recalibration) recommended |

## 🔧 Installation

### Option 1: From Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Sparamix/SQualCheck.git
cd SQualCheck

# Create virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the application
python squalcheck.py
```


## 📖 Usage

### GUI Mode

Launch the graphical interface:

```bash
# Using executable
SQualCheck.exe

# From source
python squalcheck.py
```

**GUI Features:**
- **Load SNP Files**: Click to select one or multiple S-parameter files
- **Load Folder**: Process all S-parameter files in a directory
- **Calculate**: Analyze loaded files and display results
- **Copy Table**: Copy results to clipboard for Excel/PowerPoint
- **Export**: Save results as CSV or Markdown

### CLI Mode

Process files from command line:

```bash
# Basic usage
squalcheck --cli -i input_files.csv

# With custom output prefix
squalcheck --cli -i input_files.csv -o my_results

# Process specific files directly
squalcheck --cli file1.s2p file2.s4p file3.s8p

# To run on examplef files included in the repo
python3 squalcheck.py --cli -i ./example_touchstone/example_list.csv -o test

# To run same, but only FREQ domain (initial) metrics
python3 squalcheck.py --cli --freq-only -i ./example_touchstone/example_list.csv -o test
```

**Input CSV Format:**
```csv
path/to/file1.s2p
path/to/file2.s4p
path/to/file3.s8p
```

**Output Files:**
- `{prefix}_result.csv` - Numerical results
- `{prefix}_result.md` - Formatted report with quality indicators

### Dependencies

- `numpy` - Numerical computations
- `pandas` - Data manipulation
- `scipy` - Signal processing
- `scikit-rf` - S-parameter file handling
- `tkinter` - GUI framework (included with Python)
- `tkinterdnd2` - Drag-and-drop support for the GUI (optional; GUI still works without it)
